# Also in low light scenarios 
By adaptively using both gyro and image based technology Vidhance is also optimized for low light scenarios.

Our software is robust with a high level of precision even in low light. We handle all six 
degrees of freedom, all wobbling and swaying that occurs in most videos shot on a handheld device, 
and also corrects for rolling shutter distortions.
