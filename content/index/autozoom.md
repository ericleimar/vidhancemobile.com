# Auto Zoom and and Auto Follow of moving objects

As most users who have tried to use digital zoom live while recording video on  a smartphone, the end result is typically close to useless. 
Vidhance Live Autozoom will soon empower users to instantly create engaging videos â€“ panning and zooming happens smoothly right then and there, 
allowing for direct sharing of those moments to a wider audience.

TechCrunch found our AutoZoome very interesting, read the [TechCrunch article] (http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/22/imints-vidhance-algorithms-could-soon-replace-live-video-producers/)

> This has the potential to quickly change how we think about and record video on our smartphones.
