# Auto Zoom and and Auto Follow of moving objects

As most users who have tried to use digital zoom live while recording video on  a smartphone, the end result is typically close to useless. 
Vidhance Live Autozoom will soon empower users to instantly create engaging videos – panning and zooming happens smoothly right then and there, 
allowing for direct sharing of those moments to a wider audience.
