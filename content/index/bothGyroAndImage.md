# The next battlefield to satisfy users

Most present video stabilization solutions are designed for "image stabilization", compensating for high frequency vibrations. Rather than to just let automatic shaking equipment decide what is good, Vidhance is optimized for low frequency and higher amplitude motions with long duration, i.e. the most common video situations from hand-held filming. 

By adaptively using both sensor data and patented optical analysis methods we combine the best of both worlds creating a premium result with minimal latency.
