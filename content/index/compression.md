Existing video encoding techniques do not handle hand-held video well. Small camera rotations render built-in compression methods significantly less efficient.

Using Vidhance video stabilization ahead of encoding dramatically improve compression efficiency, yielding smaller file sizes and allows for higher quality video when streaming under a given bitbudget.

This means that:

  - more video can be stored in the phone's memory
  - upload times are reduced, and
  - the video quality is improved in live feed applications, such as video conferencing.
